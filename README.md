 "Enterprise Systems" Course provided by Information Technology Institute (ITI).

In this course, we learned about ERP systems, Benefits, Architecture, Vendors, the Implementation Life Cycle of ERP systems, and much more.

At the end of this course, we were asked to prepare a case study about a company that uses an ERP system, how it is implemented, how it helped the company to achieve benefits and an analysis of its results.

For this, I'm happy that I and my great team  prepared a case study about Government Resource Planning (GRP) , Dubai government has successfully implemented the Oracle e-business suite, as partof its Government Resource Planning (GRP) project, a new hybrid of ERP customisedfor governments.
